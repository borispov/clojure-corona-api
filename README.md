# corona-api
nCorona.live's api rewritten in Clojure, because:
- Learning Reasons
- Had to fix couple of DB issues, figured I'd give up on DB and use Redis
    entirely, but try to learn Clojure as I always wanted.


This is written in the quickest way I could make it. Otherwise, it'd take
too long.
